# GoldSrc Python
A project where I *try to* remake Half-Life and a general 3D engine which I may or may not use in the future projects.

All Half-Life assets used in this project are registered trademarks of Valve Corporation.

Rest of the assets are either made by myself or gathered from open-source collections like [freesound.org](https://freesound.org/).
